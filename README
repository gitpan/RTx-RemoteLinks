NAME
    RTx-RemoteLinks - Conveniently create links to ticket IDs in other RT
    instances

DESCRIPTION
    With a small amount of configuration, this extension lets you enter new
    ticket links as "foo:123" which are then displayed in the Links box as
    "Foo ticket #123" with a link to the remote RT instance.

    Currently remote ticket subjects are not fetched due to authentication
    complications, but this could be added in the future.

CONFIGURATION
        Set(%RemoteLinks,
            Foo => 'example.com',               # assumes http:// and RT at the top-level path
            Bar => 'https://example.net/rt',    # specifies https and a subpath for RT
        );

    Make sure to add this plugin to @Plugins as well, as described in
    "INSTALLATION".

INSTALLATION
