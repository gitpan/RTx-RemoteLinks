NAME
    RTx-RemoteLinks - Conveniently create links to ticket IDs in other RT
    instances

DESCRIPTION
    With a small amount of configuration, this extension lets you enter new
    ticket links as foo:123 which are then displayed in the Links box as
    "Foo ticket #123" with a link to the remote RT instance.

    Currently remote ticket subjects are not fetched due to authentication
    complications, but this could be added in the future.

CONFIGURATION
        Set(%RemoteLinks,
            Foo => 'example.com',               # assumes http:// and RT at the top-level path
            Bar => 'https://example.net/rt',    # specifies https and a subpath for RT
        );

    Prefixes are case insensitive, so both "Foo" and "foo" and "fOo" will
    work.

    Once you create links in the system using a prefix, you should leave it
    configured.

    Make sure to add this plugin to @Plugins as well, as described in
    "INSTALLATION".

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        If you are using RT 4.2 or greater, add this line:

            Plugin('RTx::RemoteLinks');

        For 4.0, add this line:

            Set(@Plugins, qw(RTx::RemoteLinks));

        or add RTx::RemoteLinks to your existing @Plugins line.
